You want to create a platform that allows people to create blogs, similar to blogspot.com. Your platform should allow users to register, create multiple blogs, and even allow the user to invite other users to be co-administrators of the blog. The administrators of the blog can change the blog name, add posts, edit posts, add comments, edit comments for each post, and upload new files associated with the blog post.  You also want to capture information about which page the logged in users are viewing (e.g. page visited, when they visited, how long they stayed, ip address, name, etc).  

Please create an ERD for this platform.
