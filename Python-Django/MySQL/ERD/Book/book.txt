We want to create a web application that allows users to see a list of different books, with each book having a title and an author name. We also want the users to save a list of their favorite books. 

Please create necessary ERD for this application using MySQL Workbench. 

(For the purposes of this assignment, include the author's name directly in the book record, even though it is usually preferable to create a separate authors table.)
